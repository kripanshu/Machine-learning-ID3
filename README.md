# Machine-learning-ID3
In decision tree learning, ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) is an algorithm invented by Ross Quinlan used to generate a decision tree from a dataset. ID3 is the precursor to the C4.5 algorithm, 
and is typically used in the machine learning and natural language processing domains.

The project is made with java.
The project gives the half made tree and rest is done by the program using the conditional probability and the entropy.
